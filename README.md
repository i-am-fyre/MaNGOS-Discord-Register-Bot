MaNGOS Discord Registration Bot is a project aiming to provide server administrators with an easy way to register new players to their MaNGOS server through their Discord channel.


# Pre-alpha version :abc:

MaNGOS-Discord-Register-Bot is currently in an untested pre-alpha state. That means that there may be a lot of bugs, issues, and security holes.
I take no responsibility for any damage or lost data caused by using this bot.

DISCLAIMER:
- Use at your own risk!
- Always back-up data before testing. 
- Test on a local server first before using it on a public server. 
- Test using data that is not important. 
- Test with a small group first. 

Please feel free to contribute to the project, and report any issues you may encounter.

# Getting Started :1234:

## Cloning this project :point_right:

```git
git clone https://github.com/i-am-fyre/MaNGOS-Discord-Register-Bot
```
## Creating a Discord Bot :hammer_and_wrench:
I used this website: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html

## Initializing all the packages :package:

MaNGOS-Discord-Register-Bot is written in Python, so you need to install all pre-requisites. (I've included the commands for setting up a virtual environment as well, omit if not needed.)

```python
python3 -m venv ./.venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Setting up the bot :robot:
1. Open 'config.ini'.
2. Follow all instructions for each config value.
3. Save and close.
4. Once bot is added to your server, type in your bot's command prefix followed by the word 'summon'.
    Example: ;summon
5. Your bot should post the registration embed and links!

Within your Discord server, users can also type: /register
This will also open up the registration modal.
